 a graph of purchasing managers' indexes (PMIs) for several Middle Eastern countries. The y-axis shows the PMI, and the x-axis shows the countries. A PMI is a number from 0 to 100 that reflects the economic health of a country's manufacturing sector. A PMI above 50 indicates that the manufacturing sector is expanding, while a PMI below 50 indicates that it is contracting. The graph also shows two ranges labeled "Historical Range" and "Latest."

Here's what the graph shows for each country:

Saudi Arabia: The PMI for Saudi Arabia is in the latest range and is above 50, indicating that the manufacturing sector is expanding.
Qatar: The PMI for Qatar is not shown.
UAE: The PMI for UAE is in the latest range and is above 50, indicating that the manufacturing sector is expanding.
Egypt Arab Rep.: The PMI for Egypt is in the latest range and is above 50, indicating that the manufacturing sector is expanding.
Lebanon: The PMI for Lebanon is not shown.
EMDES: I couldn't find information about what "EMDES" refers to in the context of purchasing managers' indexes.

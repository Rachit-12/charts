The graph you sent appears to show the oil production index of the GCC (presumably referring to the Gulf Cooperation Council) and other oil exporters relative to January 2022, which is set at a baseline of 100.

The index for both the GCC and other oil exporters appears to have fluctuated between January 2022 and March 2023. Overall, both indexes seem to have increased slightly over that period.

Here’s a more detailed breakdown of what the graph shows:

The oil production index for the GCC started at 100 in January 2022, then increased to 104 in March 2022. It then dipped slightly to 102 in May 2022 before rising again to 104 in July 2022. The GCC’s oil production index then dipped to 100 in September 2022 before rising to 106 in November 2022. It then reached 108 in January 2023 and 112 in March 2023.
The oil production index for other oil exporters started at 100 in January 2022 and then increased to 102 in March 2022. There was a steeper increase to 108 in May 2022 followed by a decrease to 104 in July 2022. The index for other oil exporters then increased to 106 in September 2022 before rising to 110 in November 2022. It reached 112 in January 2023 and 116 in March 2023.
It’s important to note that the graph doesn’t show which specific countries are included in the “other oil exporters” category.

Additional factors to consider when interpreting this graph include:

The impact of global oil prices on production levels.
Changes in global demand for oil.
Geopolitical events that can disrupt oil production and exports.

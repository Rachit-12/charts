**Overall Summary:**

The stacked bar chart shows the contribution to global growth (%) by different regions and economies for the years 2010-19 average, 2022 (estimated), 2023 (forecast), and 2024 (forecast). The chart shows that the contribution of the United States and the Euro area to global growth has decreased from the 2010-19 average to 2022e, while the contribution of other AEs, China, and other EMDEs has increased. The contribution of India has remained relatively stable. The chart also shows that the contribution of the World (RHS) has decreased from 2022e to 2023f and 2024f. This suggests that the global economy is becoming more diversified, with emerging markets and developing economies playing a larger role in driving growth. However, the overall contribution to global growth is expected to decline in the coming years, which could be due to a number of factors, such as the ongoing global economic slowdown, the war in Ukraine, and rising inflation.

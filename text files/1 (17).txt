The plot shows the exchange-rate adjusted inflation rates across MENA (%) for different countries. The countries are grouped based on their exchange rate arrangements: Fixed/conventional peg, Other FX-arrangements, and Memorandum. The average year-on-year (y/y) inflation from October 2021 to February 2022 for DJI is 3%, for JOR is 5%, for IRQ is 6%, for OMN is 4%, for SAU is 2%, for BHR is 2%, for KWT is 4%, for ARE is 2%, for QAT is 5%, for PSE is 2%, for MAR is 3%, for TUN is 6%, for DZA is 9%, for EGY is 2%, for IRN is 4%, and for LBN is 18%. The average y/y exchange rate adjusted inflated from March 2022 to December 2022 for DJI is 6%, for JOR is 5%, for IRQ is 5%, for OMN is 3%, for SAU is 3%, for BHR is 4%, for KWT is 6%, for ARE is 6%, for QAT is 6%, for PSE is 4%, for MAR is 7%, for TUN is 8%, for DZA is 8%, for EGY is 2%, for IRN is 5%, and for LBN is 5%. The US y/y headline inflation rate from March 2022 to December 2022 is 8%. The plot shows that the exchange-rate adjusted inflation rates are higher than the average y/y inflation rates for most countries. This suggests that the depreciation of currencies in these countries has contributed to higher inflation. The plot also shows that the exchange-rate adjusted inflation rates are higher than the US y/y headline inflation rate for most countries. This suggests that inflation is higher in MENA countries than in the United States.

Overall Summary: The plot shows the exchange-rate adjusted inflation rates across MENA (%) for different countries. The countries are grouped based on their exchange rate arrangements: Fixed/conventional peg, Other FX-arrangements, and Memorandum. The plot shows that the exchange-rate adjusted inflation rates are higher than the average y/y inflation rates for most countries. This suggests that the depreciation of currencies in these countries has contributed to higher inflation. The plot also shows that the exchange-rate adjusted inflation rates are higher than the US y/y headline inflation rate for most countries. This suggests that inflation is higher in MENA countries than in the United States. This could be due to a number of factors, including the global economic slowdown, the war in Ukraine, and the rising interest rates in the United States.

The image you sent is a graph about the average effective exchange rate between Morocco, Tunisia, and Egypt.

The average effective exchange rate is a measure of how much a country's currency has changed in value relative to a basket of currencies of its major trading partners. It is calculated by taking a weighted average of the exchange rates between the country's currency and each of its trading partners' currencies. The weights are based on the amount of trade that the country does with each of its trading partners.

The graph shows that the average effective exchange rate of the Moroccan dirham, the Tunisian dinar, and the Egyptian pound all decreased between January 2022 and May 2023. This means that these currencies all became weaker relative to the currencies of their major trading partners.

There are a number of factors that can cause a country's currency to weaken, such as:

A decrease in the country's interest rates
An increase in the country's inflation rate
A decrease in foreign investment in the country
A political or economic crisis in the country

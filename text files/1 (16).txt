It shows growth of EMDES (Emerging Market Debt Securities) according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  However, based on my knowledge about EMDES, I can provide a general explanation:

The y-axis of the graph would likely be labeled "Growth in EMDES (%)" and the x-axis would be labeled "Year." The data points would show that EMDES have grown steadily over the years shown on the graph.

Possible explanations for the growth of EMDES:

Economic growth in emerging markets: Emerging markets are generally considered to be countries that are in the process of developing their economies. As these economies grow, there is a demand for investment capital. This can lead to an increase in the issuance of EMDES.
Increased investor interest: Investors are often attracted to emerging markets because of the potential for high returns. As investor interest in emerging markets has increased, this has led to an increase in demand for EMDES.
Here are some additional things to keep in mind:

Investing in EMDES can be risky. Emerging markets are often more volatile than developed markets. This means that the prices of EMDES can fluctuate more widely.
The future growth of EMDES is uncertain. It will depend on a variety of factors, such as economic growth in emerging markets, investor sentiment, and global interest rates.

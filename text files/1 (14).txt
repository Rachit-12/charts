The plot shows the oil production for GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) and other oil exporters from January 2022 to March 2023. The oil production is indexed to 100 in January 2022. The oil production of GCC increased from 100 in January 2022 to 103 in March 2022, and then further increased to 108 in September 2022. The oil production of GCC then decreased to 103 in November 2022, and then remained relatively stable at around 103 until March 2023. The oil production of other oil exporters increased from 100 in January 2022 to 102 in March 2022, and then decreased to 98 in May 2022. The oil production of other oil exporters then increased to 105 in July 2022, and then decreased to 103 in September 2022. The oil production of other oil exporters then decreased to 104 in November 2022, and then remained relatively stable at around 104 until March 2023. The plot shows that the oil production of GCC has been relatively stable over the past year, while the oil production of other oil exporters has been more volatile. This suggests that the GCC countries have been able to maintain their oil production levels, while other oil exporters have been more affected by factors such as the global economic slowdown and the war in Ukraine.

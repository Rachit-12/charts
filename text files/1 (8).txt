 is a line graph showing the PBIT (Profit Before Interest and Tax) as a percentage of sales. The y-axis is labeled "PBIT AS % OF SALES" and the x-axis is labeled "FY," which likely refers to fiscal year. The data points show that PBIT as a percentage of sales has fluctuated somewhat over the five years shown on the graph, from FY 2019 to FY 2023.

In FY 2019, PBIT was 14.1% of sales.
It then decreased to 12.2% of sales in FY 2020.
There was a slight increase to 11.2% of sales in FY 2021.
It remained flat at 11.2% of sales in FY 2022.
PBIT then dipped slightly to 9.4% of sales in FY 2023.
Without more information about the company or industry that the graph represents, it is difficult to say for sure what is causing the fluctuations in PBIT as a percentage of sales. However, some possible explanations include:

Changes in revenue: If the company's revenue has been increasing, but its expenses have been increasing at an even faster rate, then PBIT as a percentage of sales will decline.
Changes in cost of goods sold: The cost of goods sold (COGS) is a direct expense that a company incurs in producing the goods or services that it sells. If the COGS has been increasing, then PBIT as a percentage of sales will decline.
Changes in operating expenses: Operating expenses are the indirect costs of running a business, such as rent, salaries, and marketing. If operating expenses have been increasing, then PBIT as a percentage of sales will decline.

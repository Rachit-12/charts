The plot shows the Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) and Return on Net Worth (RONW) of a company for the fiscal years (FY) 2019 to 2023. The ROCE started at 26.8% in FY19 and decreased to 23.5% in FY20. It then increased to 25.5% in FY21 and decreased to 19.3% in FY22. Finally, it increased to 23.9% in FY23. The RONW started at 23.9% in FY19 and decreased to 23.7% in FY20. It then increased to 25.2% in FY21 and decreased to 18.3% in FY22. Finally, it increased to 22.0% in FY23. Both ROCE and RONW show a decreasing trend from FY19 to FY22, suggesting a decline in the company's profitability. This could be due to various factors such as increased competition, rising input costs, or a decline in sales. However, both metrics show an increase in FY23, indicating a possible improvement in the company's financial performance. This improvement could be due to factors such as cost-cutting measures, new product launches, or an increase in market demand. The ROCE is generally higher than the RONW, suggesting that the company is more efficient in utilizing its capital than its net worth. This indicates that the company is able to generate higher returns from its investments compared to its overall net worth. Overall, the plot suggests that the company's profitability has been declining in recent years, but there is a possible improvement in FY23. Further analysis is needed to understand the reasons behind these trends and to assess the company's future prospects.

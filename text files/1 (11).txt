Overall Summary: The plot shows the contribution to global growth (%) for different regions from 2010-19 average to 2024f (forecast). The contribution of the United States, Euro area, Other AEs, China, India, and Other EMDES to global growth has been declining since 2010-19 average. The contribution of the world to global growth has also been declining since 2010-19 average, but it is expected to increase in 2024f. This suggests that the global economy is becoming more diversified, with a greater contribution from emerging markets. The decline in the contribution of the United States, Euro area, Other AEs, China, India, and Other EMDES to global growth is likely due to a combination of factors, including the slowdown in global economic growth, the rise of emerging markets, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in the contribution of the world to global growth in 2024f is likely due to the expected recovery in global economic growth.
